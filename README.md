## Overview

using what I have learned from this track so far (JavaScript and DOM manipulation) - Build the navigation menu - Add functionality to distinguish the section in view - Add the functionality to scroll to sections. - Add scroll to top button - Build a responsive navigation menu

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See responsive nav bar for mobile, tablet and large screens
- See dynamic nav menu that changes with respect to the number of sections in the page
- See active state section and the respected link
